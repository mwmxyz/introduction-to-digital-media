## Course Description

![Computer Screen bearing melting rainbow text](DIG2000_HTML_1.png)

*"Computer Screen bearing melting rainbow text" generated by Michael Merriam using Midjourney

Digital Media students must understand and master the digital world that they live in, and so they must become familiar with the tools and platforms they will use in their classes and careers. This course offers an introduction to that digital domain, its hardware structures and software programs, and focuses on the responsibility of those who create and use digital content.

Students will attend class online, take notes, review outside readings, participate in discussions, and produce projects to attain these goals. The class is intended as an entry-level pre-requisite for further participation in the School of Visual Arts & Design. It is, therefore, required that any student who wishes to continue in the program successfully complete the requirements of this course.

## Course Objectives

By successfully completing the requirements of this course, students should be able to:

- Identify the way different mediums contribute to the “global village” created and sustained by digital media
- Identify the major evolution of the computer and the digital domain through the the 20th/21st century.
- Describe the essential properties and tools that make digital environments work. 
- Contribute to discussions of the evolving place of AI in content creation
- Create content demonstrating proficiency in digital image manipulation and digital sound design 
- Assess the strengths and weaknesses of networking (hardware and social) within the digital domain and its affect on our work and our relationships. (Data, Networking, Privacy)

## Materials and Texts

The only required textbook is 
Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud
William Morrow Paperbacks
ISBN-10   006097625X
ISBN-13  978-0060976255

The following texts are not required. They are recommended — and if you don’t wish to check them out of the library or obtain copies of them, you might still get a lot out of looking for information about these texts. YouTube alone is a rich resource, as many YouTubers discuss these books. Sometimes the authors themselves have informative YouTube channels or blogs. 

Story – Robert McKee

The Hero with a Thousand Faces – Joseph Campbell

Techgnosis - Erik Davis

Understanding Media - Marshall McLuhan

Each week, plan on following following instructions in online modules regarding readings and online exercises. Each module will be divided into three sections:

- **Weekly readings.** Additional required readings and viewings in the form of short linked articles and almost always a brief video lecture from the instructor will be found in each week's module. All the information therein is helpful to you, but perhaps more importantly, it is all fair game for quizzes or the final exam. 
- **Discussion.** A weekly discussion will ask that you post some work, either purely written or a combination of writing and creative work with a digital medium, to a public discussion board, and you will also be asked to respond to some of your classmates. Discussions are required, and will be graded very leniently, on a completion basis. 
- **Announcements** With a large class like this, your instructor cannot always answer each student individually, but he will respond to the class as a whole, and will mention the contributions of specific students, in occasional videos sent to all of you via the Announcements. You must watch these videos, as it involves the hard work of you and your classmates, and is helpful in identifying common concerns, trends, and most importantly, as a way to showcase some of the excellent or groundbreaking work you and your colleagues are doing in class.

## Evaluation and Grading

| Points  | Assignment Summary | Due Date  |
|---|---|---|
| 5  | **Activity Verification** - Complete the brief Discussion about 'Mediums' posted on Webcourses as soon as possible to confirm your enrollment in the course. As this is required by the university, please attend to it as soon as possible at the start of classes. | Friday, January 12th  |
| 45  | **Discussions** - Nine weekly discussions will consist of sharing your thoughts and sometimes your work. They may or may not contain instructions for additional reading. They often address things that are not addressed in the other readings, but they will always be relevant to the module's topic. There will be no required discussions on weeks with large project deadlines: each discussion is worth 5 points, and the lowest discussion grade will be dropped, allowing for one missed week. | Weekly |
| 30  |  **Projects** - Projects are to be uploaded into the assignment in the module in Canvas, not emailed to me. The upload spot in Canvas may also ask you for a text input, often so that you can turn in the required explanation of your process or description of your project which you must turn in along with the project itself. Read the instructions in the assignment and make sure you are supplying both the file of your project and whatever written component is also required. | Periodically  |
| 10 |  **Quizzes** - Five quizzes on various topics, often more technical than aesthetic or subjective | Periodically |
| 10 |  **Final Exam** - A final exam in the form of a project prompt, to be done at home and turned in at the appropriate spot on Canvas. It will require use of most or all of the skills and concepts you have learned about during the course. Because the class will be closed after finals week, it is not possible for your instructor to accept late final exams, or to grnt extensions. Your instructor would like to be able to do this for you, but the computerized system simply closes, and it is not anything over which your instructor has control. | Friday, May 3rd |

Students can access their grades and feedback at any time using the Grade Book function of Webcourses. All assignments will be submitted through Webcourses. Plan on checking the site at least twice a week for updates and assignment information. Grades are calculated out of 100 following a standard letter scale.

Late work is more difficult to accept and grade than it may appear. It causes many difficulties for your instructor, and costs other students time and attention, when students turn in late work. Therefore, if circumstances require extension beyond that deadline, please reach out to the instructor immediately. As assignments throughout the course are designed to build on the previous exercise, assignments must be completed in sequence.

## Asynchronous Course Structure

This course uses an asynchronous format, and relies upon students to complete all readings, engage with both pre-recorded and external videos, and join in on course discussions. All assignments are due on Sunday night at the close of their listed module. Once an assignment closes, late work will not be accepted unless an additional extension has already been approved by the instructor: please reach out early if circumstances will require additional time!

- Office hour assistance is available both through text on Webcourses messages and via Zoom: reaching out through Webcourses first is recommended, and Zoom meetings will be scheduled at mutually convenient times.
- All course materials are asynchronous, using a mix of video and text as appropriate. However, the course does require consistent weekly participation following the listed schedule - it is not self-paced!
- Students will need access to a reliable internet connection and computer, chromebook, or tablet in order to participate in the course. Students are not required to install software, but will have the option to do so for some critiques.
- In the event of an emergency or medical challenge, additional flexibility beyond the grading guidelines is available: when anticipated, students should reach out to the instructor as soon as feasible to form a plan or discuss an incomplete if needed. Note that incompletes will not be awarded with more than two missing assignments, and must be completed within six months of the close of class.

## General Policies

### Academic Integrity

[The Center for Academic Integrity (CAI)](http://academicintegrity.org/) defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action.

**UCF Creed:** Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and excellence are the core values that guide our conduct, performance, and decisions.

1. Integrity: I will practice and defend academic and personal honesty.
2. Scholarship: I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of my membership in the UCF community.
3. Community: I will promote an open and supportive campus environment by respecting the rights and contributions of every individual.
4. Creativity: I will use my talents to enrich the human experience.
5. Excellence: I will strive toward the highest standards of performance in any endeavor I undertake.

Students should familiarize themselves with [UCF's Rules of Conduct](https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/). According to Section 1, “Academic Misconduct,” students are prohibited from engaging in

1. Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.
2. Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else’s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.
3. Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor’s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.
4. Falsifying or misrepresenting the student’s own academic work.
5. Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another’s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student’s own.
6. Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.
7. Helping another violate academic behavior standards.
8. Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements.

### Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, [The Golden Rule](https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/). UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students’ education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an “F” letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a “Z” designation on one’s transcript.

### Course Accessibility Statement

This course is built with universal design for learning principles in mind: if you encounter challenges with any of the course materials, assignments, platforms, or requirements, please reach out for assistance, and know that additional support is always available regardles of documentation. If changes in course modality occur and you require additional accomodations, please reach out as soon as possible.

Additionally, the University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/) (Ferrell Commons 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

### Campus Safety Statement

Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

- In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.
- Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide’s physical location and review the [online version](http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html).
- Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.
- If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see [locations](https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations).
- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to [MyUCF](https://my.ucf.edu) and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
- Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.
- To learn about how to manage an active-shooter situation on campus or elsewhere, consider viewing this [video](https://youtu.be/NIKYajEx4pk).

### Deployed Active Duty Military Students

Students who are deployed active duty military and/or National Guard personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive notification of deployment to make related arrangements.

### Authorized Events and Religious Observances

Students who represent the university in an authorized event or activity (for example, student-athletes) and who are unable to meet a course deadline due to a conflict with that event must provide the instructor with documentation in advance to arrange a make-up. No penalty will be applied.

Students must notify their instructor in advance if they intend to miss class for a religious observance. For more information, see the [UCF policy](http://regulations.ucf.edu/chapter5/documents/5.020ReligiousObservancesFINALJan19.pdf). No penalty will be applied.

### Title IX Policy

Title IX prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual misconduct, sexual violence, sexual harassment, and retaliation. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find resources available to support the victim, including confidential resources and information concerning reporting options at [Let's be Clear](https://letsbeclear.ucf.edu) and [SDES](http://cares.sdes.ucf.edu/).
